One of the most important forms of communication is public speaking, but most children are often intimidated and dread it when they have to speak in front of groups. Some children seem to have a natural ability to participate in public speaking, but regardless of skill level, almost all children can benefit from furthering their skills in an <a href=\"https:\/\/ivycampsusa.com\/pages\/public-speaking-debate-from-ivy-camps-usa?utm_campaign=LiveIntent%20-%20Public%20Speaking&utm_source=LiveIntentArticle&utm_medium=text&utm_content=online%20public%20speaking%20class\" title=\"https:\/\/ivycampsusa.com\/pages\/public-speaking-debate-from-ivy-camps-usa?utm_campaign=LiveIntent%20-%20Public%20Speaking&utm_source=LiveIntentArticle&utm_medium=text&utm_content=online%20public%20speaking%20class\"><em><strong>online public speaking class<\/strong><\/em><\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/ivycampsusa.com\/collections\/summer-programs-2022\/products\/arts-media-and-communication-summer-program?utm_campaign=LiveIntent%20-%20Public%20Speaking&utm_source=LiveIntentArticle&utm_medium=text&utm_content=summer%20program\" title=\"https:\/\/ivycampsusa.com\/collections\/summer-programs-2022\/products\/arts-media-and-communication-summer-program?utm_campaign=LiveIntent%20-%20Public%20Speaking&utm_source=LiveIntentArticle&utm_medium=text&utm_content=summer%20program\"><em><strong>summer camp<\/strong><\/em><\/a>. Learn more below about why it is vital for your child to start improving their public speaking skills as soon as possible.<\/p><p><strong>Improve Confidence and Leadership skills<\/strong><\/p><p>As your child becomes more comfortable with public speaking they will view themselves differently, as they will feel more confident in their ability to communicate. Children become better at making themselves understood, but they are also able to inspire and persuade others on their position. This is essential to becoming a leader and history has shown that successful leaders have amazing public speaking skills.<\/p><p><strong>Advance Listening Skills<\/strong><\/p><p>When children are on their way to becoming a great public speaker they have built excellent listening skills. While taking online classes kids are often put into situations where they have to listen to a problem and then provide an appropriate response. The more they hone their listening skills, the better they are able to comprehend complex subjects as they further their education. <\/p><p><strong>Become Better at Writing<\/strong><\/p><p>Children who are learning how to improve their public speaking skills are forced to eloquently articulate their thoughts and arguments. This can be extremely beneficial to them in school, especially as students prepare essays for their college applications.<\/p><p><strong>Better career opportunities<\/strong><\/p><p>After students finish school they have to start their careers and this means they have to master the interview process. If they have strong communication skills because of public speaking education, then this will not be as challenging for them because they have experience and confidence.<\/p><p><strong>Overall academic improvement<\/strong><\/p><p>When young children become confident public speakers they are also more comfortable raising their hand in class to participate. This means they are more engaged in learning and therefore tend to get more benefit from the overall learning experience.<\/p><p><strong>Organizational Skills<\/strong><\/p><p>One aspect of learning public speaking is preparing your thoughts to give a presentation. This process puts children’s organizational skills to the test as they have to be very focused and structured about what they are going to say when they give their speech.<\/p><p><strong>Improve influence and persuasion <\/strong><\/p><p>Public speaking often involves trying to persuade or influence people to see your side of the topic at hand. As children gain experience with dozens of different public speeches, they become confident in how to present themselves and what they have to say, which can help make people side with their side of the argument.<\/p>"
